# Description

This is FreeCAD macro that gets chipboards dimensions to cut. This macro creates spreadsheet named "toCut" with all needed things to cut chipboards for your woodworking project.

# Install

Create new macro in FreeCAD and paste this code in your macro.

# Usage

Create chipboards and run macro. In FreeCAD chipboards are made of cube objects (e.g. data tab for cube can be like 500 x 500 x 18). I will try to explain this step better in the future. Maybe someone who understand it will make any youtube video tutorial about it?

# Printing

FreeCAD not support direct printing for spreadsheets. So you have to export your spreadsheet to csv. Then you have to copy the csv data to LibreOffice and convert it to the table. After some corrections (add mm and adjust table columns) you can print it and go to cut your chipboards to market or any other woodworking service that provide wood cutting.
